It is crucial for companies as well as small business to plan their products which are going to put on sale, in intention of maximizing revenue. But quite often happens a situation where products are unbalancedly sold. Some products are sold quickly and some are not likely to be touched.

For instance, the bakery owner can recommend a customer who buys bread to also buy coffee with special price, because those two items are oftenly bought together.
